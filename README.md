# SentiStock - Stock Market Sentiment Analyzer

## Background

SentiStock was inspired by my long-standing interest in the stock market and my experiences as a high school senior, when I started investing heavily. I observed that many people lacked the resources to make informed investment decisions. This gap inspired me to create SentiStockâ€”a tool designed to empower investors with actionable insights into stock sentiment.

## Motivation

The project was driven by the realization that accurate, reliable sentiment analysis is critical for informed stock market decisions. Many available tools offered vague recommendations without context or relied on incomplete data sources. SentiStock was developed to address these challenges by providing clear, data-driven buy/hold/sell recommendations with supporting summaries and source links.
